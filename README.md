# Forge Hello World

### Notes
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
  - Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
  - Use `--upgrade` flag for manifest updates
